<p style="text-align: justify;">Indonesia's interactive malnutrition dashboard, which includes several dependent variables, namely Prev Stunting, Wasting, Underweight, Overweight, and the Proportion of children under 5 years of age. I created this dashboard as my streamlit project.</p>

# Definition of Variables
1. **Prev Stunting** -> Prev Stunting refers to the prevalence of stunting, the percentage of children whose height-for-age is below the standard, indicating chronic malnutrition and growth failure.
2. **Wasting** -> Wasting is a condition where a child's weight-for-height is significantly below the standard, indicating acute malnutrition often due to illness or insufficient food intake.
3. **Underweight** -> Underweight refers to children or individuals whose weight-for-age is below the standard, indicating overall malnutrition, typically due to poor nutrition or illness.
4. **Overweight** -> Overweight refers to individuals whose weight-for-height (BMI for adults) exceeds the standard, indicating excess body fat that may lead to health risks.
5. **Proportion** -> Proportion refers to the percentage of a specific group within a larger population, such as the proportion of children affected by stunting.
